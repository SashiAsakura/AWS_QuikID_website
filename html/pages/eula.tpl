				<p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FUSIONPIPE Licensed Programs are for standard commercial uses.  Without the appropriate design and engineering, they must not be sold, licensed or otherwise distributed for use in any hazardous environments requiring fail safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of products could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.  End User hereby agrees that the use of the FUSIONPIPE Licensed Programs for the development of any such application without the prior written consent of FUSIONPIPE shall be at the End User’s sole risk.  End User also agrees to defend and hold FUSIONPIPE harmless from any claims for loss, cost, damage, expense or liability that may arise out of or in connection with the use of the FUSIONPIPE Licensed Programs in such applications.</p>
				
				<h3>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY</h3>
				<p>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN NO EVENT SHALL FUSIONPIPE, ITS EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY COSTS, LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL CLAIM, REGARDLESS OF HOW SUCH DAMAGES WERE CAUSED OR AROSE AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE, AND/OR FUSIONPIPE HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THE FOREGOING EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS IN CONTRACT INCLUDING FUNDAMENTAL BREACH OR BREACH OF A WARRANTY, CONDITION OR FUNDAMENTAL TERM OR IN TORT INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR IN STRICT LIABILITY.</p>
				<p>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing provision limiting the liability of FUSIONPIPE' employees, agents, officers and directors shall be deemed to be a trust provision, and shall be enforceable by such employees, agents, officers and directors as trust beneficiaries.</p>
				
				<h3>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GENERAL</h3>
				<p>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under no circumstances shall either party be liable to the other for any failure to perform its obligations where such failure results from causes beyond that party's reasonable control.</p>
				<p>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between FUSIONPIPE and End User regarding the license provisions and supersedes all prior oral and written communications.</p>
				<p>7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be severed and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
				<p>7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Licensed Program may contain freeware or shareware obtained by FUSIONPIPE from a third party source.  No license fee has been paid by FUSIONPIPE for the use of any such freeware or shareware, and no license fee is charged to End User for its use.  End User acknowledges and agrees that the third party source provides no warranties and shall have no liability whatsoever in respect of End User's possession and/or use of the freeware or shareware software.</p>

				<p>7.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No term or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed waived and no breach excused unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the party claimed to have waived or consented.  The waiver by either party of any right hereunder, or of the failure to perform or of a breach by the other party, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other right hereunder or of any other breach or failure by such other party, whether of a similar nature or otherwise.</p>
				<p>7.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia.  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby expressly excluded.</p>
